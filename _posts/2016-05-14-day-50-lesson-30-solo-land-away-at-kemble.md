 * The weather was again poor this morning, so I had to wait to see if it would improve enough for my solo flight to go ahead.
 * To the north, where Kemble airfield is, the weather was lovely.
 * By 10am it was still overcast at Bristol, but the weather had improved enough, so Derek signed me out.
 * I called Kemble to check the weather there and booked in, estimating my arrival time to be 10:45
 * I flew over Clifton Suspension Bridge and over the city of Bristol.
 * Then over Yate and started looking for Badminton.
 * The Horse Trials had finished, so it was much harder to find. I eventually spotted it, but finding a green grass runway in a green field surroundd by green fields is not easy!
 * Then past The National Arboretum and over the restricted zone at HRH Price Charles' residence.
 * As I approached Tetbury I switched over to Kemble Information and announced my position.
 * I completed an overhead join, and landed well on runway 08. I was asked to park on the grass in front of the cafe.
 * I paid my landing fee and bought a cup of tea and a doughnut from the cake and sat in the sun to enjoy these.
 * Then it was time to return. I completed a transit check of the aeroplane, checking the surfaces and oil level.
 * I took off and climbed in the circuit until I was 2,000 feet above the aerodrome. I set course for Tetbury, avoiding the mistake I made last week of wrongly identifying Tetbury as Malmesbury.
 * While abeam Badminton I struggled to identify the runway. I circled the area looking for it, but couldn't see it. I could see Yate and Bristol so decided to press on rather than confirm I was at Badminton.
 * I re-joined Bristol air traffic zone and landed back on Runway 09.
 * It felt great today, landing at another airfield on my own. I felt like a proper pilot!
