 * My PPL skills test was booked for Saturday, but the weather isn't looking good so the club called and asked if I could do it today!
 * After quickly re-scheduling my day I return from the office to plan a flight to Hereford via Ledbury.
 * I purchase a month's subscription to SkyDemon and plug my flight plan in there.
 * It was worth it, as it instantly shows I've planned to fly through a danger area.
 * I update my flight plan to avoid this and head off to the airport feeling excited and nervous at the same time.
 * Once there my examiner, Mark, takes me through what's involved and checks my pilot's log to ensure I've done everything necessary to take the test.
 * He looks at my flight plan and asks me to update it so as to plan to go to Hay-on-Wye.
 * I do this and add my calculations for the wind and complete a load sheet.
 * Soon we're in the plane preparing to go.
 * I'm given taxi clearance and make my way to the holding point.
 * There's quite a lot going on so I have to hold for quit a while. Mark suggests I throttle back and decrease the mixture. I say I haven't done that before and he says not to worry, it's not part of the test.
 * Soon we're given take off clearance and I climb straight out. Mark suggests I turn early to free up the airspace for the departing commercial jet.
 * We're passed over to Bristol Radar and I make my way across the River Severn and over Caldicot.
 * As I fly towards Ledbury I check I can identify everything on my map.
 * There are supposed to be wind-farms to my right, I struggle to find them, but only for a moment, there they are.
 * "What are you looking over there for?" says Mark, "We're heading towards the Malverns, those big hills straight in front of us!"
 * This threw me as Derek had drummed it into me that I should always know where I was.
 * Next Mark asks what my QNH is set to, I realise I haven't switched over to London Information and asked for the regional QNH, nice prompt!
 * I speak with Bristol Radar and ask to "QSY to London Information".
 * Mark asks me if I had a passenger aboard who felt ill, what would I do.
 * I say depending on how urgent it was I'd either return to Bristol or divert to a nearby airport.
 * Mark asks me which one and I again say it would depend on how urgent, but I'd prefer a larger airport to a grass strip so in this instance I'd probably divert to Gloucestershire.
 * He says "and if it was really urgent?" I check my map and say Ledbury is the closest.
 * Mark tells me to find it, I strain my eyes and search the landscape, but I can't find it. Mark says it's behind a tree line and admits it's a hard one to spot. My choice of of Gloucestershire was the better option.
 * Then Mark asks where we're going now? Oh dear, in all the excitement of finding Ledbury airfield I've overflown my turning point, overhead Ledbury! Another helpful hint from Mark.
 * I turn and fly towards Hay-on-Wye, I can see the town of Hereford in front of me, so I aim for that rather than trying to spot every feature on my map.
 * We get to Hereford and Mark says he'd like me to plan a diversion to Kemble.
 * I get my ruler out, draw a line from Hereford to Kemble, estimate the heading and measure the distance.
 * It's 33 nautical miles away at a rough heading of 120&deg;, which I estimate will take us 22 minutes.
 * I radio London Information and inform them I'm doing a practice diversion, give them my destination and an ETA.
 * I'm unsure about the accuracy of my heading so I obsess over every little detail on my map.
 * I look up as we're crossing the M50 motorway and see another aeroplane flying from left to right in front of us, just a few hundred feet away.
 * After exclaiming Mark tells me I have my head in my map rather than looking outside.
 * He asks me what the biggest feature is on my map "Errr..." I say, he says "The big yellow thing, right in front of us", "Gloucester?" I say. "Gloucester" he says.
 * Use that as my reference point, not a road in the middle of nowhere.
 * I'm really starting to feel nervous now. Have I been fed too many hints to pass my test?
 * Next up Mark asks me to get a fix using radio navigation aids. I tune Brecon VOR, but we're quite a long way from it, but I do enough for Mark to be sure I know what I'm doing. "That's fine" he says.
 * We fly past Gloucester and I can make out the docks and can see Gloucestershire airport in the distance. Ahead I can see Kemble airfield.
 * I request a QSY for Kemble Information from London Information and am passed over to their frequency.
 * As we approach I know I have to do an overhead join, I read in [Nic Rodgers' blog](http://learningtofly.nicrodgers.com/2014/10/failing-a-ppl-skills-test/) that he failed his Skills Test because he mucked up his overhead join, so the pressure's on.
 * I say that I have to descend this side, so can I do that now or do I need to actually overfly the airfield?
 * Mark says it's fine to do it here so I reduce power, apply carburettor heat and radio Kemble Information to say I'm descending dead side.
 * "Why have you slowed down?" Mark asks. "To descend at 70 knots" I say. Mark nods, then says "You do like to waste your money don't you". I'm not quite sure how to take that.
 * I cross the numbers over the runway as I fly the crosswind leg. Then I turn onto downwind, radio the tower and run through my landing checks.
 * There's an aeroplane ahead of me and another behind me in the circuit.
 * I've only ever landed on runway 26 once before, and that was on my Qualifying Cross Country. It's a tricky approach as you have to avoid the village of Kemble.
 * I concentrate on avoiding Kemble but don't descend enough, so once aligned on the extended runway centre line I have to almost glide down.
 * The plane in front of me is taking its time to turn off the runway, so I don't yet have permission to land.
 * Then the tower give the plane behind me clearance to land, confusing us for them.
 * Mark tells me to go-around. So I apply full power and straighten up.
 * Mark says I must take the drag flaps off when going around.
 * I say I'm waiting for my speed to increase. He says "No, always take the drag flaps off first".
 * I feel like I've binned it now. I climb back into the circuit and turn base, then when at 1,000 feet I turn downwind.
 * "You do like wasting your money don't you" says Mark, "this is the sort of circuit I'd expect a Vulcan bomber to fly"
 * I try to ignore that comment and concentrate on the approach, but again I'm high and have to glide down to the runway.
 * I flare and touchdown nicely. But I'm left of the centre line. Mark quips that "We usually land on the centre of the runway"
 * I'm feeling very dejected now. I take off and re-enter the circuit. This time I have to do a flap-less landing. Perhaps I can get a partial pass.
 * On this approach I time my descent better and try very hard to aim for the centre. Perhaps a little too hard. My landing's a little rough with some last minute rudder.
 * I take off and Mark asks me to fly back to Bristol, I reach for my map and he says "You don't need that do you? Just fly south and look for the Severn estuary and bridges."
 * I climb up to 3,000 feet and then am told to run through the HASELL checks. I get my check list out and Mark again quips that it's not that difficult to remember.
 * Now we go through a power-off stall. I reduce power and keep pulling the nose up. I feel the controls go sloppy, then the airframe shudders, the red stall warner light illuminates and the stall is established.
 * I push the nose forward, apply power and recover from the stall. Mark seems happy with that.
 * Then I have to recover from a stall in landing configuration while in the turn, as if turning final.
 * I slow down, apply the flaps and turn while holding the nose up. Once I start stalling I recover. Again, Mark seems happy.
 * Then I'm told to simulate an engine failure. I reduce power, apply carburettor heat and can see that directly beneath me is the long grass runway of Badminton. Perfect!
 * I tell him I'm aiming for that and he is happy with that. I spot my 1,000 feet marker, turn base and then turn final. We get to 500 feet and Mark tells me that's good enough and to climb out.
 * As I'm climbing Mark tells me to simulate an engine failure on take off, I'm already over 1,000 feet high, so I have plenty of time to choose a field.
 * I select a good looking one and turn towards it. Mark is happy with that.
 * But he says I didn't "warm" the engine. I say that Derek had always done that and I hadn't ever taken it upon myself to do it. (Another reason I've failed perhaps?)
 * Next up is a steep turn. I gently turn into 30&deg; and apply a little power as I continue turning to 60&deg; while holding the nose up.
 * Mark then takes the controls and says a steep turn is done as an emergency manoeuvre and demonstrates a sudden steep turn. (More evidence I've failed.)
 * Then Mark puts the plane into a high speed descending turn and asks me to recover. I level the wings but forget to take the power off. Mark asks me to do it again, this time I do it a bit better.
 * After all that we return to Bristol. The circuit is clear and no one is on long final so we're given number one and cleared to land.
 * Mark asks me to perform a powered off landing, but I pull the power off much too early and he grabs my hand as I go to apply the first stage of rudder.
 * "You'll never make it from here" he says. Oh dear. He says instead we'll do a performance landing.
 * I've only ever done one performance landing, but I know what to do. So I aim for the numbers and touch down as slow as possible and apply breaks. Mark seems happy with it.
 * We turn off the runway and I'm sure I've failed. As I park up I wait for those immortal words confirming my fears.
 * Mark talks me through a few issues with my flying. He says QSY is an old fashioned phrase, I should instead use "request frequency change". He also comments on my map reading and how I need to concentrate on what's out the window more.
 * Then he gets out of the plane and asks me to put the control locks on. He didn't tell me I've failed...
 * When I get back to the club Barry congratulates me and shakes my hand. I can't believe it. I've passed!
 * My hours get logged as P1.S, pilot in command under supervision. So I can log them as Pilot In Command (PIC) hours. Now that I can take passengers that's what my time is recorded as, not solo hours.
