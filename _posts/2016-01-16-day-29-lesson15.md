 * First lesson in 8 weeks!
 * With a new instructor this week, Andrew
 * It's very cold, Andrew is outside preparing the plane (by turning it towards the sun!)
 * I tell him that Derek thought I was ready for my solo but it's been two months since I flew, so I may have forgotten too much
 * We go though the what I have learnt and head out to the plane
 * Andrew says to skip the ATIS and just call the tower, I'm not used to this!
 * We get going but have a short wait before take off
 * The cold weather means we're fogging up in the cockpit before take off.
 * 1st landing is atrocious, I forgot to put the 3rd stage of flap down and Andrew has to take the controls
 * 2nd landing is much better, but the runway centreline is off and I land without flairing
 * Extend downwind on 3rd circuit
 * 3rd landing is starting to improve
 * 4th and 5th landings are good
 * Andrew says after the next landing he's sending me for my solo!
 * We get stuck orbiting waiting for traffic
 * It's too busy and ATC refuse Andrew's request for me to go solo
 * I feel gutted :-(
