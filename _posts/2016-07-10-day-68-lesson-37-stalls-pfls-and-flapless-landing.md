 * The weather was looking pretty bad when I woke up this morning, misty with a cloud base of just 200 feet
 * But the forecast was for it to improve by mid-morning, so I made my way to the club with my fingers crossed.
 * Derek takes me into the briefing room and we discuss what to do this lesson.
 * He says we need to do instrument appreciation and should revise steep turns, stalls and PFLs
 * I say "that sounds good for today's lesson" but Derek says we can't cover it all, so we'll cover PFLs and stalls.
 * We head out via Cheddar Reservoir and climb to 3,000 feet, run through a HASELL check and stalls
 * Then we move onto PFLs, but I'm really struggling to pick a good field, I keep choosing ones that are too close.
 * The last one is okay, but I choose a field with a ravine in it. Not good for walking away from a forced landing :-(
 * Then, on our way back to Cheddar I practice some steep turns.
 * Derek then says I should land without flaps, which I do quite comfortably. I'm pleased with my landings now.
 * Back at the club, Derek says he's putting me in for my Skills Test next Saturday, my heart skips a beat!
 * Therefore, I must complete my theory exams. So I drive home, collect my books and revision notes and return to the club.
 * In the afternoon I sit my Aeroplane Technical, Navigation and Meteorology exams, all passed, which is a relief.
 * Now I've got to cram in revision for the remaining theory exams, which I'll sit on Wednesday.
 * I also book my RT practical for Thursday evening. It's going to be a busy week :-S
