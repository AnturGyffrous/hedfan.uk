Today I was booked in to fly with a different instructor, Nafis. But the club phoned to
say the weather was terrible and my lesson would have to be cancelled. Not how I wanted
the New Year to start.

When I first started booking flying lessons I was advised to book twice as many as I
wanted, because the British weather was likely to cancel half of them. Well, I've had 14
lessons so far and today is the 28th day, so I have now proved that statistic correct.

#### TOTAL FLYING HOURS = 15.5
