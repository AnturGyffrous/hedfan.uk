I spent Saturday sitting in the park with the sun beating down on me watching the planes
fly overhead. Today however, it is a different story. Overcast and raining. The flying
club called to say the weather was bad and was forecast to get even worse. So no flying
today.

I knew there was a possibility this would happen, even a likelihood knowing the British
weather. But now it actually has I feel really quite disappointed. I was so looking
forward to my first lesson, just to say I had started my training. But now that will have
to wait. I'm booked in next weekend on both Saturday and Sunday, so hopefully at least one
of those days will have flyable weather.

Jason Smart talks about the struggles of learning to fly with the British weather in his
book [Take Your Wings and Fly - A Journey Through a Private Pilot's Licence](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Take-Your-Wings-Fly-Journey/dp/0956718752)
(which I [recently reviewed](/2015/05/26/take-your-wings-and-fly/)) and his journey
started in much the same way as mine, with his first lesson being cancelled due to the
weather. He ends each entry with a running total of his flying hours, an idea I'm
shamelessly stealing for my blog! So day one has ended and my count so far is:

#### TOTAL FLYING HOURS = 0.0
