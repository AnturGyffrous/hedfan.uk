 * The plan was that we'd fly to Kemble, but the weather isn't good enough, so Derek sends me out on solo circuits
 * It's the first time I've taken a plane solo right from the beginning, without an instructor at least doing one circuit with me
 * I keep it simple on the first circuit and so a normal approach and landing, but wonder if I forgot to turn the fuel pump on?!
 * The next circuit I worry about the fuel pump too much and do another normal circuit
 * Then I try a flapless one, followed by a powered off approach
 * Then I automatically put the flaps down when I should have tried another flapless one
 * So I do flapless on the next one, then finish with a powered off approach
