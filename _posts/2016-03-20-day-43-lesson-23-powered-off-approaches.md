 * Derek's not sure what to do today, flying to Dunkeswell is expensive and he doesn't want to waste my money
 * Could do solo cross country, but the cloud base is a bit low and we should cover other material before I do that
 * Derek decides we'll try and do powered off approaches at Bristol, but if we can't do that we'll do low-level nav.
 * I'm allowed in the circuit, so we do three powered off approaches.
 * These are really scary, but the first two landings are good. The next one is not so good.
 * Derek then gets out and I do a further 4 landings on my own.
 * Pleased with my achievements this weekend. Finally got some more solo experience.
