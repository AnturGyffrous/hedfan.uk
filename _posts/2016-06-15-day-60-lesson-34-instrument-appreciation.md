 * I couldn't quite believe we were going to be going flying today, the weather looked so bad.
 * I did the pre-flight checks in the rain, with heavy clouds looming overhead.
 * But Derek was adamant we were going flying today!
 * I took off and headed for Cheddar Reservoir, but struggled to locate it through the rain.
 * Once over the Mendips the weather was better, but we couldn't climb above about 1,900 feet.
 * It was a good lesson and Derek commended me on my instrument flying skills.
 * Coming back to Bristol was hairy, the cloud came right down to the Mendips.
 * We could see the ground, but only by flying a hundred feet or so from the surface.
 * Derek flew the circuit at just a few hundred feet and landed.
 * If I'd have been solo I'd have chickened out and opted to divert to another airfield or hold until the weather improved.
