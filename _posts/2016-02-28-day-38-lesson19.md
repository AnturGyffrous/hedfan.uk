[Yesterday](/2016/02/27/day-37-lesson18-circuits-in-crosswind/) had been a really hard
lesson. Today the weather was much the same, coming from 030&deg; at 12 knots. This meant
a crosswind component of about 10 knots. The aeroplane can handle a maximum crosswind of
17 knots, it's just the pilot that's struggling!

At the club I meet Martin, a fellow PPL student who started circuits last weekend. Both
him and I will be flying circuits at the same time today, him in *Juliet November* and me
in *Tango Lima*.

Unfortunately I forgot to start my GoPro recording so there's no video for this lesson,
which also means I can't reply the lesson and

 * Crosswinds again
 * Both me and Martin (a fellow PPL student) are in circuits at the same time
 * Derek shows me that the crosswind component is about 10 knots, plane can handle 17 knots, pilot only about 3!
 * Finding it hard to relax, landings are really difficult
 * Derek takes control for one approach and landing to show how it should be little movements
 * Last couple of landings were okay, but I feel quite disappointed with today's effort
