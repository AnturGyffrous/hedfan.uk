 * I arrive at the club and am told Derek is running late, *very* late!
 * I ask if that means I should just go home, but I'm told to get a cup of tea and they'll see what they can do for me.
 * Derek has flown one of the aircraft to another airfield for it to have a new engine fitted, but bad weather meant he had to divert and land
 * He was only now on his way back and wouldn't return for at leatst another hour.
 * But Phil was willing to sign me out on my solo cross country, so I looked up the winds and calculated my PLOG.
 * It was getting quite late, so I was anxious to get going.
 * I had a real struggle getting the plane onto the taxiway as I had to pass incredibly close to other aeroplanes.
 * But I got going and headed towards Wales.
 * The weather still wasn't perfect, but I found the Taf Ely Wind-farms and then flew onto Port Talbot.
 * Swansea gave me joining instructions for left hand base runway 22.
 * I flew east of the airfield, but couldn't find it on the ground.
 * I turned where I thought was downwind and then saw the runway, I had turned slightly early, so made my turn more shallow.
 * I turned base, then final and came into land, but pulled up too early and ballooned.
 * I re-configured for a second attempt but my airspeed had dropped and the stall warning light came on.
 * I applied some power and eventually landed with my nerves frayed.
 * While paying my landing fee an instructor from the club at Swansea talked to me about Juliet November, apparently they have Juliet Mike which looks identical.
 * Took off and flew around the Gower peninsula, it was such a good feeling.
 * I again incorrectly identified the Taff Ely Wind-farms, but soon realised my error and corrected my heading.
 * I flew over Caerphilly and took a photo of the castle from the skies.
 * Then over the estuary and into Bristol airspace where I landed on runway 09, but still not as smoothly as I'd have liked.
 * Next up is my Qualifying Cross Country
