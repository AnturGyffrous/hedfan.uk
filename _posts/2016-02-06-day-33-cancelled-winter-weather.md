Last weekend the weather was lovely with clear blue skies. I had a great lesson, so good
in fact that I finally did my [first solo](/2016/01/30/day-32-lesson-17-first-solo/)
flight. I was elated. Afterwards my instructor, Derek, said that next lesson he'd like to
get me flying solo again. An hour of circuits on my own would consolidate my solo hours
and help boost my confidence. I was looking forward to this.

But today the weather was decidedly miserable. Heavy rain, thick cloud just a few hundred
feet above the runway, low visibility, a strong crosswind and gusts of 35 knots. So my
lesson was cancelled.

#### TOTAL FLYING HOURS = 18.7

#### SOLO FLYING HOURS = 0.4
