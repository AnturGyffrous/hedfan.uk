My lesson today was just after lunch, Derek thought we might have to go to Kemble to fly
circuits, but when he telephoned the tower at Bristol they were happy to accommodate us.
So I made my way out to G-BNSZ, the Piper PA-28-161 Warrior II which I flew [two weeks ago](/2015/09/06/day-13-lesson-9/),
and completed the pre-flight checks. The weather was beautiful, the wind wasn't very
strong and was blowing almost straight down the runway, perfect for take offs and
landings, which today would be on runway 09.

I was a little nervous to begin with, there's so much to take in and remember when flying
circuits. You take off (known as upwind), climb to 500 feet and turn 90&deg; onto the
crosswind leg. Then at 1,000 feet you level off, by which time you'll be ready to turn
another 90&deg; and fly the downwind leg, parallel to the runway. At this point you radio
the tower and tell them your intentions (e.g. downwind for touch-and go, or to land, etc.)

Then it's the BUMPFFICH checks (Brakes, Undercarriage, Mixture, Pitch, Fuel, Fuel pump,
Instruments, Carburettor heat and Hatches and harnesses), by which point you'll be near
the end of the leg and it'll be time to turn another 90&deg; onto base. Apply carburettor
heat, reduce power to 1,500 RPM and configure the plane for a descent at 70 knots, apply
the first stage of flaps, then the second. At about 600 feet, make another 90&deg; turn
onto final and radio the tower for your landing clearance. At about 300 feet apply the
last stage of flaps and turn the carburettor heat off, you can let the airspeed drop to 65
knots now. Once over the runway threshold begin reducing power and roll-out for a perfect
landing. All in about 5 minutes.

My first landing was okay, but I didn't reduce the power all the way to idle and ended up
touching down without rolling-out (also known as flaring) very much. On the next circuit
Derek took control on final because we needed to keep our speed up to separate us from a
commercial jet, he handed back control just before touching down so I could do the
landing, but this time I rolled out too high and started to stall, Derek coached me
through the landing and we touched down nicely, but I think this was more Derek's skill
than mine!

On the third circuit the tower told me to orbit at the end of the downwind leg as there
was a lot of commercial traffic landing and taking off. Orbiting is where you fly the
aeroplane in fairly tight circles over a fixed point, the tower needed me to do this so
they knew where I was and keep me close to where I needed to be while higher priority
traffic was handled. The traffic was so busy we had to remain orbiting for nearly 15
minutes, given the hourly rate of learning to fly this was an expensive hold. You can see
my orbits in this map as the tight, overlapping circles in the lower-left-hand corner:

Although the orbiting was expensive, it did give me a chance to calm down and relax a
little, hence my third landing was "not bad" to quote Derek. The fourth circuit had some
more orbiting, fortunately not much though. Derek said very little in the approach phase
and I managed to touch-down relatively gently, but I rolled out a little high and the
stall warner was sounding as I landed.

The fifth and final approach was going fine, Derek didn't have to coach me at all and I
was controlling the airspeed and descent rate well, I felt this was going to be the
landing that would eclipse all of my previous landings. And it did. But not in the way I
was expecting. I rolled out much too high and we hit the ground hard, then the plane took
to flight again and bounced down the runway. Derek had to take control to get us on terra
firma.

I felt awful about that last landing, but I was glad the first four were much better. I
felt like I was getting there, but I really have to sort out the landing before I'm going
to be allowed to fly solo.
