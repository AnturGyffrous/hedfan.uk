Last weekend the weather was lovely with clear blue skies. I had a great lesson, so good
in fact that I finally did my [first solo](/2016/01/30/day-32-lesson-17-first-solo/)
flight. I was elated. Afterwards my instructor, Derek, said that on my next lesson he'd
like to get me flying solo again. He said that an hour of circuits on my own would help
boost my confidence. I was looking forward to this.

But today the weather was decidedly miserable. Heavy rain, thick cloud just a few hundred
feet above the runway, low visibility, a strong crosswind and gusts of 35 knots. So my
lesson was cancelled.

[Last week I flew solo for the first time](/2016/01/30/day-32-lesson-17-first-solo/), the
weather was lovely with clear blue skies.
