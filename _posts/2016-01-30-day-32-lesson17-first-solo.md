 * The wind is quite strong, but it's not gusting and is blowing straight down the runway.
 * 1st landing is okay, but not great.
 * 2nd landing is even worse, I roll-out too high and have to re-do it, but it's okay.
 * On the next circuit we're asked to keep it tight, then we have to orbit right instead of turning final, then we're told to go aroun.
 * 3rd landing is a greaser, best landing ever!
 * 4th landing is also a greaser. This feels really good.
 * We park up just off the runway and Derek hops out.
 * Now it's time for my first solo.
 * It goes perfectly.
 * My landing wasn't quite a greaser, but I was happy with it as my first solo landing.
