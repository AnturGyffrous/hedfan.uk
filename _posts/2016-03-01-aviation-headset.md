I told myself that after I had [flown solo for the first time](/2016/01/30/day-32-lesson-17-first-solo/)
I would buy my own aviation headset and stop using the club's headsets. Although there's
nothing stopping me continue to use club ones, I feel that using my own headset will give
me a little extra consistency and reduce the number of variables that can change in the
cockpit. Maybe I'm kidding myself, perhaps I just want to spend more time looking like
Maverick from [Top Gun](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/)!

Whatever my reasons for buying my own headset, the biggest obstacle was choosing the right
one. There are dozens of makes and models on the market, with price tags from just over
&pound;100 to nearly &pound;1,000. They range in weight and comfort as well as with
features like [Active Noise Reduction (ANR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_noise_control)
and even *Bluetooth*<sup>&reg;</sup> connectivity so you can make and receive phone calls.

The choice was overwhelming, and so hard to evaluate without trying them on. I spent hours
trawling websites, looking for recommendations, comparing features and checking
specifications. Although cost was clearly a factor (ruling out fancy things like
*Bluetooth*<sup>&reg;</sup> and ANR) I was willing to pay a little more for a comfortable
and lightweight headset.

So, after discussing my requirements and budget with others at the club, I plumped for the
[David Clark H10-13.4 Aviation Headset](http://www.davidclarkcompany.com/files/literature/10-13.4.pdf).
At &pound;305 it was a little more than I had planned on spending, but it came highly
recommended and is the same model used by the club, giving me the assurance I would find
it comfortable to wear.

I ordered it from [Flightstore](https://www.flightstore.co.uk/pilot-supplies-c1/headsets-c65/aircraft-headsets-c620/david-clark-h10-13-4-headset-with-free-headset-case-p230)
on Sunday afternoon, opting for their free delivery option. So I wasn't expecting it to
arrive until later in the week (which would have been fine as I don't have another lesson
until Saturday), but they dispatched it on Monday and it arrived today (Tuesday). Thank
you [@FlightstoreUK](https://twitter.com/FlightstoreUK).

It came with a free headset case. However, my [Flight Outfitters Lift Flight Bag](http://www.flightstore.co.uk/pilot-supplies-c1/flight-bags-and-cases-c107/flight-bags-c108/flight-outfitters-lift-flight-bag-p5540)
has a large headset pocket (pictured above), meaning I can fit all my equipment in one bag
and won't need to carry a separate headset case. As to whether this will help with my
[crosswind landings](2016/02/27/day-37-lesson18-circuits-in-crosswind/), we'll have to
wait and see...
