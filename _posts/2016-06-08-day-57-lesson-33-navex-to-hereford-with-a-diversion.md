 * One of the instructors who worked during the week had got a job flying private jets, so the club was down an instructor.
 * Derek offered to cover Wednesdays to help out, I took this opportunity to take annual leave and book lessons with Derek on Wednesdays in June and July.
 * However, I wasn't sure if it was going to pay off as visibility was again really low this morning, with low cloud as well.
 * I spent the first three hours of my lesson drinking tea and eating sandwiches.
 * But by the afternoon the weather had cleared enough to go flying, although visibility was still fairly low.
 * We took off and headed for the M5 Avon Bridge, but I was struggling to make out land marks in the haze and Derek had to point me in the right direction.
 * Once we left Bristol's ATZ I concentrated on ensuring I was flying the headings I had calculated.
 * We crossed overhead the Second Severn Crossing and then flew past the Suspension Bridge and over Chepstow.
 * Then we flew past Tintern Abbey, a beautiful 12th century ruin on the border of England and Wales (my wife and I visited the abbey in the early days of our courtship).
 * The visibility was low, but the Wye Valley scenery was lovely, with the River Wye snaking up to Monmouth.
 * Navigating between Monmouth and Hereford was difficult as there were so few ground features to use as reference points.
 * But I located the grass runway of Ross Airfield and the large Satellite Dish Aerials at Madley Communications Centre, so was sure I was going in the right direction.
 * Once overhead Hereford I struggled to identify the cathedral amongst all the cities buildings, but with a little prompting from Derek I soon located it.
 * Then Derek said I needed to plan to divert to Shobdon.
 * I took out my ruler and measured the distance, 12 nautical miles.
 * I also tried to measure the bearing by holding the ruler steady while moving it over a VOR beacon with its compass rose.
 * But this is easier said than done, especially while trying to fly an aeroplane!
 * I cocked up my calculations, ended up flying over 30&deg; off course and infringed a D216, a Danger Zone over the SAS's base.
 * With a bit of help from Derek and a telling off from the Air Traffic Controller, I found my way to Shobdon.
 * Then we returned to Herefored (taking extra special care to not infringe any airspace!) and continued back to Bristol.
 * Derek said my PLOG was excellent, my bearings and times were spot on. I just need to not panic when diverting, as it's part of the test.
