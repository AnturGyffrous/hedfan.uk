This evening I went to the club to sit my first three theory exams. Two weeks ago I had
[exam crammer sessions with Nick](/2016/03/15/ground-school-air-law-opps-and-comms/) where
we went through Air Law, Operational Procedures and Communications. Since then I've been
busy re-reading sections of my Air Pilot's Manuals and putting myself through mock exams
using the Examination Preparation [Questions, Answers and Explanation books](https://www.pooleys.com/shop/pooleys/qa-examination-preparation-books-1-9).

I decided to sit these three exams at the same time as you have to complete all nine exams
within six sittings. So by knocking three of them off at the beginning I have more options
if I want to space out the other exams.

Fortunately (but rather unsurprisingly given the amount of time I've spent revising,
sitting practice papers, and the ground school) I passed all three exams. Nevertheless, I
was glad to have passed without incident.
