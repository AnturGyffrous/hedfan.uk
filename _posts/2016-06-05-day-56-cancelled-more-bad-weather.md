 * Again the weather wasn't great this morning, with visibility just 6km and cloud at 600 feet
 * But the forecast was for it to improve, so I stayed at the club hoping to wait the weather out
 * It did improve, but by then other people had arrived with booked lessons
 * The staff tried their best to re-jig the diary
 * But whatever the outcome I wasn't going to be able to do my Qualifying Cross Country, and I'd have to stay at the club all day
 * So I decided to cancel and go home :-(
