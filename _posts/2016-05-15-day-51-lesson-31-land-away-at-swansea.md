 * Derek said the weather was marginal for flying to Swansea, but he thought it just good enough to fly.
 * So I called them to check the weather and book in. It was quite hazy but very little cloud.
 * They said parachuting was happening today, so they advised I make a straight in approach on runway 28.
 * We flew to the M5 Avon Bridge and then turned towards Wales, with the M4 bridges over the Severn to my right.
 * I was struggling to keep the plane flying on the correct heading, as I was heading towards features on the ground rather than pick a feature on my heading and flying towards that.
 * We switched over to Cardiff Radar and were told to remain at 3,000 feet.
 * The haze was pretty bad, Derek said you could usually see all the way to Swansea from here, but we couldn't even see Cardiff properly!
 * I identified Caerphilly and Derek confirmed this by showing my the castle in the town's centre.
 * Then over Pontypridd and on to the Taff Ely Wind-farms. I couldn't see the white windmills at all, until suddenly they appeared like a mirage.
 * There were dozens of windmills, all spread out over the Welsh mountains. They look really pretty from the sky.
 * Derek said it was important to ensure I knew which group of windmills was the Taff Ely Wind-farms, as these were at the edge of Cardiff's airspace.
 * Then we flew on towards Port Talbot, but again I wasn't flying the correct heading and ended up too far south and over the steel works, not the town.
 * Over Swansea Bay I radioed the tower and announced my position. They gave me a straight in approach to runway 28.
 * I couldn't even see the airport through the haze. Derek pointed it out to me and I started preparations for landing.
 * As I hadn't flown a circuit I wasn't in quite the right frame of mind and let my airspeed fall too much.
 * I tried to correct this, but ended up making quite a hard landing, which I was disappointed with.
 * After paying the landing fee we were on our way again, back to Bristol
 * The cloud had gotten a little worse and it made spotting the wind-farms really difficult.
 * I wanted to turn north through a bad in the clouds, but Derek said the ground was higher to the north, we should always favour lower ground in marginal conditions.
 * I was worried about infringing Cardiff's airspace, but Derek was checking our position using SkyDemon and said we were fine.
 * I miss-identified the Taff Ely Wind-farms as a nearby farm to the north, Derek said it was unfair to criticise me because of the cloud cover, but pointed out the correct wind-farm so I could be sure of our position.
 * We flew to the north of Cardiff and south of Newport, then over the Severn. Derek pointed out Clevedon (it has a pier) and Portishead (it doesn't have a pier!)
 * Then we re-joined Bristol air traffic zone and landed.
