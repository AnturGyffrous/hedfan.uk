With holidays, weather cancellations and Christmas it's been 8 weeks since my [last lesson](2015/11/22/day-26-lesson-14-circuit-bashing/),
so I was very glad to be back at The Bristol and Wessex Aeroplane Club. Today I would be
flying with a different instructor, Andrew, in *Tango Lima*.

Andrew and I spend a while going over what I had learnt so far. I said that Derek had
thought I was ready for my solo, but given that was nearly two months ago I expected to be
quite rusty. I also mention that I'd been reading up on radio telecommunications as I
hadn't been very precise in a few of my calls last lesson.

Once in the plane Andrew tells me to call for clearance to start. I ask if we should
listen to the ATIS first but Andrew says the tower will give us what we need for circuits.
We're given our engine start and taxi clearance and after a short wait for commercial
traffic we're cleared for take off.

 * First lesson in 8 weeks!
 * With a new instructor this week, Andrew
 * It's very cold, Andrew is outside preparing the plane (by turning it towards the sun!)
 * I tell him that Derek thought I was ready for my solo but it's been two months since I flew, so I may have forgotten too much
 * We go though the what I have learnt and head out to the plane
 * Andrew says to skip the ATIS and just call the tower, I'm not used to this!
 * We get going but have a short wait before take off
 * The cold weather means we're fogging up in the cockpit before take off.
 * 1st landing is atrocious, I forgot to put the 3rd stage of flap down and Andrew has to take the controls
 * 2nd landing is much better, but the runway centreline is off and I land without flairing
 * Extend downwind on 3rd circuit
 * 3rd landing is starting to improve
 * 4th and 5th landings are good
 * Andrew says after the next landing he's sending me for my solo!
 * We get stuck orbiting waiting for traffic
 * It's too busy and ATC refuse Andrew's request for me to go solo
 * I feel gutted :-(
