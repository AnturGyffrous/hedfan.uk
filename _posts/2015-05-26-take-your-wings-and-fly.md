I've just finished reading Jason Smart's first paperback "Take Your Wings and Fly - A Journey Through a Private Pilot's Licence". It's a book that charts his progress through learning to fly light aircraft in the UK.

Jason was living in Bradford, West Yorkshire in the North of England when he decided he wanted to learn to fly. A friend took him up in a microlight, a very small and light aeroplane that Jason likens to a toboggan with a propeller attached to the back. With the wind rushing past his face in the open cockpit and his vertigo kicking in he admitted he'd never been more scared in all his life!

Undeterred he returned to Barton Aerodrome near Manchester a few weeks later for a trial lesson in a Cessna 152. This time, in the heated cockpit of the light aircraft, he loved the experience. Thrilled at taking the controls for the first time, holding the plane straight and level and practising a few turns he decided he would peruse his dream of learning to fly. After passing his aviation medical, studying the training manuals and saving up for the (unfortunately quite expensive) flying lessons he started his training.

The remainder of the book charts his progress through the UK Private Pilot's Licence (UK EASA PPL) in diary form, showing the date for each entry along with lesson number, total flying hours and exercises conducted.
