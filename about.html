<p>Welcome to my blog, Hedfan. First, let me introduce myself; my name is Owain, I am in my mid-thirties and I live in Bristol in the South West of England. I started this blog as I&#8217;ve been fascinated with flight since I can remember and wanted to share my passion for aviation with others.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always loved the thrill of powering down the runway in an aeroplane, that force pushing you back into the seat as the craft accelerates to takeoff speed is exhilarating. And while others were daunted by airports I&#8217;ve always found them exciting. As a child I was invited into the cockpit of a Boeing 747 mid-flight and was awestruck. I&#8217;ve played flight simulation games, piloted a light aircraft on a trial lesson, been aboard Concorde (admittedly only on the ground in a museum, but that still counts right?), been a member of a Virtual Airline and even parachuted out of an aeroplane.</p>

<p>So why Hedfan? Well, I was brought up in Wales, not England. Hedfan is the Welsh word for flight or flying (actually, &#8220;hedegog&#8221; is probably a closer translation to flying, &#8220;hedfan&#8221; just means flight, but it&#8217;s shorter and easier to say, so that&#8217;s why I chose it!) In Welsh, a single &#8216;f&#8217; makes a &#8216;v&#8217; sound, so you pronounce it &#8220;head-van&#8221;.</p>
