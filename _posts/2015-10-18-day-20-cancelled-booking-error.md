As I mentioned in [yesterday's lesson](/2015/10/17/day-19-lesson-13-crosswind-circuits/) I
was supposed to have two lesson's this weekend, but a booking error meant there was no
Piper PA-28 for me to fly this morning, so the lesson was cancelled. As it happened the
weather was rubbish, so I wouldn't have been able to fly anyway.

#### TOTAL FLYING HOURS = 14.3
