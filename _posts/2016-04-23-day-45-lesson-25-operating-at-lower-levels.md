 * Last week's crack in an engine pipe really spooked me, so I take extra care in the pre-flight checks
 * Today's lesson is all about operating at lower levels
 * We descend to just a few hundred feet and observe how the wind blows us off track as I turn
 * We do 180 degree turns and then full 360 degree circles
 * Then we climb and practice some advanced turns
 * My turns to the right are okay, but I loose height turning left
 * Observe sinking effect over the Mendips because of the wind
