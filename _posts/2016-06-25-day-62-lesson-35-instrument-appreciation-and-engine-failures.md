 * The weather's still not great, with cloud and rain in the area
 * But the cloud base is high enough for my lesson to go ahead
 * Derek briefs me on instrument failures, the most likely cause being suction failures affecting the artificial horizon and the DI
 * If this happens then I'll have to use the altimeter as my primary instrument and scan the working instruments for additional feedback
 * There's a lot of activity on the south side of the airfield today, traffic for the Glastonbury festival has closed off parts of the taxiway
 * We make our way out to JN and complete the checks. The tower ask if I'm north of the barrier, I get confused and say no, Derek corrects me.
 * I take off on 27 and fly out of the ATZ via Cheddar reservoir, the Glastonbury festival site is clearly visible and enormous.
 * Derek suckers black-out plates over the instruments he's pretending have "failed" and asks me to climb and descend without them.
 * This goes okay, but we struggle to coordinate turns with the compass, Derek is not sure it's working correctly
 * Next Derek takes me though an engine failure after take off
 * The key is to dip the nose immediately to ensure you don't stall and maintain 70 knots
 * Then it's my turn. I dip okay but aim for a field that's much too close
 * On another attempt I choose a field with a ravine running through it, Derek's not sure we'd have survived that landing!
 * We return to Bristol and my landing's quite good, however I get airborne again, but I still manage to touch down smoothly.
