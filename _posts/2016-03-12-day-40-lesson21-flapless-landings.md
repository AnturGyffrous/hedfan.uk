The weather today looks beautiful, perfect for flying. I check the `METAR` and am pleased
to see it report very light winds, visibility of 10km of more and no cloud detected:

The `TAF` also looks wonderful, forecasting wind from 220&deg; at 5 knots, visibility of
10km or more and few clouds at 4,500 feet for the rest of the day.

So, as you can imagine, I was surprised when the club phoned to say that my lesson might
not go ahead. It turns out that although visibility on the ground is perfect for flying,
visibility aloft is very low because of haze. Apparently you can't even see Bristol City
from the airport, which is only about 5 miles away.

Fortunately, my lesson wasn't scheduled until late afternoon, by which time the haze had
cleared up enough for circuits. It wouldn't have been good enough for navigation, so I was
glad the wind was light with no crosswind.

Derek is away this weekend, so today I'm flying with Phil in *Tango Lima*. We have a chat
in one of the briefing rooms and go over what I have learnt so far. Phil suggests that
today we fly flapless approaches and landings. He explains that with no flap the stall
speed will be higher so we need to fly faster on the approach, 80kts instead of 70kts as
it would be with full flaps. He also gives me another check list he finds useful (and
amusing), he calls them the **CRAP** checks!

 * **C**arburettor - *off*
 * **R**unway - *clear*
 * **A**pproach - *looking good*
 * **P**ermission - *given to land*

As I'm taxing I see an easyJet plane taking off. The tower give me permission to enter the
runway and backtrack. I read back the instruction but say I don't need to backtrack.
However, the controller says if I line up at the intersection I'll have to wait 3 minutes
before I can take off, if I backtrack I will only have to wait 2 minutes, so I agree to
backtrack.

Phil explains this is to do with the wake turbulence created by the larger aeroplane
taking off. It will have used most of the runway before being fast enough to fly, so the
wake turbulence would have started a long way down the runway. If I wanted to take off
from the intersection, I would lift off at a similar point. Therefore, I need to wait 3
minutes for their wake turbulence to dissipate. If I backtracked to the start of the
runway, then I'd be fast enough to fly much earlier than the other plane, thus able to
climb above their wake turbulence. Which is why I'd only have to wait 2 minutes before
starting my take off role.

 * TAF and METAR look perfect for flying.
 * But the club phones to say visibility aloft is very low because of haze.
 * I call the club just before my lesson and they say it's just about okay.
 * Today, I'm flying whith a different instructor, Phil. We spend a while going over what I've learnt and re-capping the circuit.
 * Phil gives me a new landing checklist, CRAP, Carburettor Heat, Runway Clear, Approach Good and Permission Given.
 * Phil suggests we do flapless landings today.
 * We start with a full flap landing and I'm pleased with it. My first good landing since my solo!
 * The second one is a semi-flapless landing, just two stages, not three. The landing is fine, but I forget the carburettor heat, must learn CRAP.
 * Third landing is a flapless one, so CRAP is important, I get to C and realise I forgot to turn carburettor heat ON! The landing is good though.
 * Fourth landing is also flapless. This time I remember carburettor heat and CRAP. The landing is good again.
 * Fifth landing is a full flap one and goes well.
 * Controller asks to speak to the instructor and congratulates us on perfect circuits, 6 minutes each.
 * Feel really chuffed
 * But, I'm forgetting Pitch in my BUMPFFICHH checks, not always straight on landing and must check RPM returns to normal after carburettor heat.
 * Phil also reminds me of the Lights, Camera, Action checklist when about to enter the runway
 * Must remember to idle the throttle when testing the breaks at start.
