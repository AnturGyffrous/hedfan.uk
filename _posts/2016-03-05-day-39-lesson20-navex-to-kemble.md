 * I calculate a flight log to Kemble and back using my whizz-wheel and forecast winds.
 * Still a strong crosswind, so Derek decides we'll just fly over Kemble, we won't land
 * I take off west on 09 and turn right towards Bristol City and Clifton Suspension Bridge
 * Once over the bridge I can climb to 2,500 feet.
 * We fly past the now closed Filton airfield and then over the town of Yate
 * Derek points out the long grass strip at Badminton (where the horse trials are held), it take me a while to see it.
 * I identify Tetbury in the distance and ensure we're above 2,000 feet while flying over Prince Charles' estate.
 * Then I switch to Kemble Information and give them my position and intentions.
 * We overfly and try to see the landing square, but it's not out today.
 * Then we return towards Bristol, the sun is in my eyes and I find it hard to identify distant fratures
 * Also, I only visualised the flight on the map going to Kemble, not coming back, so I'm a bit all over the place.
 * I fly over Tetbury again and switch back to Bristol Radar (LARS)
 * Then I see Badminton to my left and Yate ahead with Bristol in the distance.
 * The sun means it's still difficult to see features and I can't find the suspension bridge, but I can see Clifton Downs, so aim for that.
 * I contact Bristol Tower and am given permission to enter controlled airspace.
 * My landing instructions are to join right base at Barrow Tanks behind the aircraft on long final.
 * I am visual with the plane, so extend downwind for wake turbulence and then turn base and final.
 * It's still a crosswind so I'm pointing into wind. As I kick straight my death grip on the controls makes for a scary and bunpy landing.
 * Still struggling with crosswinds. This is bad :-(
