The forecast last night hadn't looked very good, but this morning the weather was lovely,
so I drove to the airport feeling positive. The wind was blowing straight down the runway,
which meant there wouldn't be a crosswind, but it was quite a strong 15kt wind.

Derek calls the tower and books us out for circuits while I go through the pre-flight
checks. Today I'm flying *Juliet November*, the same plane as [last week](http://localhost:4000/2016/01/23/day-30-lesson16-warminster-navigation-exercise/).

The first circuit is uneventful and I land fairly well. The second circuit is also
uneventful, but I panic slightly just before touching down and my landing isn't as good as
the first one.

On the third circuit the tower asks me to keep it tight as there's commercial traffic
coming in to land. Then, just as I'm about to turn left onto final the tower asks me to
turn right. This confuses me and I have to ask for clarification. He wants me to turn
right, loop round and then land. However, by the time I've done this the approaching
traffic is too close and I'm told to *go around*.

A *go around* is where you come in to land, but don't touch down. Instead, power is
applied while still in the air and you climb back up and come round for another go at
landing. It's a useful procedure to know and this was the first time I had flown one.
However, when we were back up at 1,000 feet Derek reminded me that the flaps were still
down. Whoops!

## The Best Landing I've Ever Done

After the *go around* I have to orbit at the end of the downwind leg for 10 minutes while
commercial traffic comes and goes. Although it's expensive flying in circles, it certainly
helped me relax, as my landing was perfectly smooth, a *greaser* as it's known in aviation
parlance. Derek comments that it was "the best landing you've ever done".

On the next circuit Derek asks if I feel ready to do one on my own. "Yes" I say, I've been
ready [since Andrew tried to send me solo two weeks ago](/2016/01/16/day-29-lesson-15-am-i-ready-to-solo/).
So Derek radios the tower and says:

> If we made this a full stop sir, could you accept a student into the circuit for his
> first solo?

To which the the tower replies:

> That will be fine.

He goes on to say the next commercial traffic is about 25 minutes away, so I have plenty
of time. I come round and land just as well as last time and feel excited about flying
solo.

## First Solo

Derek takes the controls and taxies us off the runway. Then he says I need to prefix my
callsign with the word "Student" when on my own, for example "Student Golf Bravo Charlie
Juliet November". Derek parks up and tells me to have a lovely flight, then he gets out
and it's just me in command of the aeroplane.

The tower confirms my clearance and gives me permission to take off. I apply full power,
accelerate to 60 knots, pull back on the control column and start to fly. With just me in
the plane the climb performance is better than with Derek sat next to me and I am ready to
turn onto the crosswind leg sooner than normal, so I turn just 45 degrees to make sure
I'll have enough time on the downwind leg to complete all my checks.

As I fly round the circuit I keep talking to myself, almost imagining Derek sat next me
telling me what to do. It's remarkably helpful and I even remember to apply carburettor
heat before starting my descent.

I control the approach well, keeping an eye on my speed and making sure I don't descend
too much or not enough. As I fly over the A38, just before the runway threshold, I see
cars driving along and mentally pinch myself as I imagine them looking up at me, wishing
they were pilots too.

But I don't let this distract me; I start pulling back the power as I descend over the
runway and flare just slightly high. I correct for this and touch down well, but it wasn't
quite the greaser the last two landings were. However, I'm happy to call it my first solo
landing.

I slow my aeroplane down and am asked to vacate the runway via the next taxiway. I
acknowledge this request and the tower follows with:

> And congratulations, nicely done.

I grin from ear to ear. I've done it! My first solo!
