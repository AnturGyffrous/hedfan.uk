Recently I've bought volume three [Navigation](http://www.pooleys.com/prod_detail.cfm?product_id=9),
volume four [The Aeroplane Technical](http://www.pooleys.com/prod_detail.cfm?product_id=8)
and volume seven [Communications](http://www.pooleys.com/prod_detail.cfm?product_id=5) of
the Air Pilot's Manuals.

I also bought the [1:500,000 Southern England and Wales chart](http://www.pooleys.com/prod_detail.cfm?product_id=31)
(often described as the half-million, or even just half-mil chart). It's an unwieldy thing
that I can't imagine trying to use while flying an aeroplane. Derek joked with me that one
way of using charts is to fold it however you want, then pick the airfield in the centre
and make that your home airfield!

I did a bit of Googling and came across this rather fascinating guide to
[folding an aviation chart](http://www.cosfordflyingclub.org/MEMBERS_AREA/Secure%20PDFs/CPFC_Forms/CPFC%20-%20Fold%20a%20chart.pdf)
from [Cosford Flying Club](http://www.cosfordflyingclub.org/) and I must say I am pleased
with the results, but I dread trying to unfold it in the cockpit if I ever fly off the
edge of a fold.

I've also now got a purpose made flight bag, rather than the satchel I was using when I
starter learning to fly. I chose the [Flight Outfitters Lift Flight Bag](http://www.flightstore.co.uk/pilot-supplies-c1/flight-bags-and-cases-c107/flight-bags-c108/flight-outfitters-lift-flight-bag-p5540)
from [FlightStore](http://www.flightstore.co.uk/). It's just right for my needs, it has
pockets on the sides for a fuel tester, 

I've also got the [Flight Outfitters Lift Flight Bag](http://www.flightstore.co.uk/pilot-supplies-c1/flight-bags-and-cases-c107/flight-bags-c108/flight-outfitters-lift-flight-bag-p5540)
which is a great little flight bag and the [Pooleys CRP-1W Computer](http://www.pooleys.com/prod_detail.cfm?product_id=2504)
which I have no idea how to use yet!
