 * Crosswind at Bristol, so we combine a navigation exercise to Dunkeswell with circuit practice
 * Leave via Cheddar and fly south over Bridgewater and Taunton
 * Switch between Bristol Tower, Bristol Radar and Dunkeswell Radio (it's an A/G aerodrome, so no controller)
 * Do three circuits with Derek, then he hopps out and I go solo!
 * Complete 5 circuits, first landing a bit bumpy, but others are better
 * Then I pick Derek up and we fly back to Bristol
 * Map reading all the way, Derek doesn't want me to waste my money taking in the view.
 * Re-join Bristol control zone, but radio interference makes it very difficult to communicate.
 * Turns out to be a problem with Juliet November, not me.
 * Have to orbit for ages and them am given permission to land.
 * Follow a commercial on final and land just after another commercial takes off
 * Landing is too hard as I don't flare correctly. Feel annoyed with myself about that.
