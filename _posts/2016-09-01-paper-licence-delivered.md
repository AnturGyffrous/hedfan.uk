I [passed my PPL skills test](/2016/07/14/day-70-ppl-skills-test/) 7 weeks ago. I
submitted my application for the initial issue of a PPL a couple of days later, on
Saturday 16th July 2016, using the [CAA's online application form](http://www.caa.co.uk/General-aviation/Pilot-licences/Applications/Licences/Online-application-forms/).

Their website says they "*try to process all applications within 10 working days*" but
their processing time "*is currently 15 working days*". After 4 weeks I emailed them to
ask for an update but got an automated response stating "*If your e-mail is an application
for licence issue, amendment or renewal, we aim to process within 25-30 working days.*"

Today I finally received my licence, couriered by FedEx, 33 working days since I submitted
my application!
