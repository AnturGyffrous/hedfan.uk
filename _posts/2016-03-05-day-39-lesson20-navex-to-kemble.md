Last weekend had been challenging, a strong crosswind with gusts meant that even though I
flew on both Saturday and Sunday; and completed a total of 13 take offs and landings, I
still didn't manage to fly any of them solo, as Derek felt I wasn't quite confident
enough to handle a crosswind landing on my own.

Therefore he'd suggested that for the next lesson we'd give the touch-and-goes a rest and
instead we'd go on a navigation excersise to [Kemble (Cotswolds Airport)](http://www.cotswoldairport.com/).
I was tasked with creating a PLOG (pilot's log) and accounting for the wind, magnetic
variation, air pressure and temperature.

I've been reading the [Navigation](http://www.pooleys.com/prod_detail.cfm?product_id=9)]
book (volume three of the Air Pilot's Manuals) in order to learn how to use my
'whiz-wheel' and how to create a PLOG. It's much more complicated than it first seems. I
needed to plot the route on my chart by drawing a line between Bristol and Kemble,
measuring the length using a [navigation ruler](http://www.pooleys.com/prod_detail.cfm?product_id=138)
and the heading using a [square protractor](http://www.pooleys.com/prod_detail.cfm?product_id=96).

Charts almost always use true north, but magnets point to magnetic north. You may not
realise this, but magnetic north is in a different place to true north and its position
changes year by year. Therefore, once you have claculated your heading using a chart and
true north, you need to account for magnetic variation and adjust your heading
accordingly.

Also, the higher you fly, the less air pressure exists, therefore the faster you'll fly.
So you need to estimate the temperature and pressure at altitude and use a navigation
computer (often called a 'whiz-wheel') to work out your true airspeed.

Finally, you need to get an accurate weather report for the wind speed and direction at
your intended flight altitude. The Met Office produce a Low-Level Spot Wind Chart (Form
214) for this exact purpose. Then you need to make use of the other side of the
'whiz-wheel' too see how this will affect your heading and ground speed.

It was this last part that made me realise I had perhaps bought the wrong 'whiz-wheel'. I
went for the [Pooleys CRP-1W Computer](http://www.pooleys.com/prod_detail.cfm?product_id=2504)
which contains a wind arm, but this wind arm hindered more than it helped. If I made my
choice again I would go for a 'whiz-wheel' without a wind arm.



 * I calculate a flight log to Kemble and back using my whizz-wheel and forecast winds.
 * Still a strong crosswind, so Derek decides we'll just fly over Kemble, we won't land
 * I take off west on 09 and turn right towards Bristol City and Clifton Suspension Bridge
 * Once over the bridge I can climb to 2,500 feet.
 * We fly past the now closed Filton airfield and then over the town of Yate
 * Derek points out the long grass strip at Badminton (where the horse trials are held), it take me a while to see it.
 * I identify Tetbury in the distance and ensure we're above 2,000 feet while flying over Prince Charles' estate.
 * Then I switch to Kemble Information and give them my position and intentions.
 * We overfly and try to see the landing square, but it's not out today.
 * Then we return towards Bristol, the sun is in my eyes and I find it hard to identify distant fratures
 * Also, I only visualised the flight on the map going to Kemble, not coming back, so I'm a bit all over the place.
 * I fly over Tetbury again and switch back to Bristol Radar (LARS)
 * Then I see Badminton to my left and Yate ahead with Bristol in the distance.
 * The sun means it's still difficult to see features and I can't find the suspension bridge, but I can see Clifton Downs, so aim for that.
 * I contact Bristol Tower and am given permission to enter controlled airspace.
 * My landing instructions are to join right base at Barrow Tanks behind the aircraft on long final.
 * I am visual with the plane, so extend downwind for wake turbulence and then turn base and final.
 * It's still a crosswind so I'm pointing into wind. As I kick straight my death grip on the controls makes for a scary and bunpy landing.
 * Still struggling with crosswinds. This is bad :-(
