 * This British "summer" weather's really getting me down now.
 * I'd had 6 lessons and logged a total of 8.4 hours in May, but only 3 lessons and 3.7 hours in June
 * It feels like I am really close to getting my licence, but bad weather keeps interrupting my lessons
 * If I'm to ever do my qualifying cross country I need the weather to be good over the entire route, not just at Bristol
 * Right now it feels like that'll never happen.
