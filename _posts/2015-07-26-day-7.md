[Yesterday]((/2015/07/25/day-6/)) had been a lovely day and the flying was magnificent
(even if talking on the radio was terrifying). Not 24 hours later it was overcast and
raining, typical British weather, so today's lesson was cancelled.

I decided to read up on air law instead; far less fun than flying.

#### TOTAL FLYING HOURS = 4.5
