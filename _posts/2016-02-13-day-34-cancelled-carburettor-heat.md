The weather today was rubbish, so another week would have to pass before I could
consolidate my [first solo](/2016/01/30/day-32-lesson-17-first-solo/). I was on such a
high after that lesson and really hoped to get out flying solo again soon. Now I'm worried
I'll have lost momentum and will need more lessons before being allowed to fly on my own.

Well, rather than spend time worrying about it, I thought today I'd write about
carburettor heat as it's something I mention in almost every blog post, but haven't gone
into much detail before.

NATS publish a series of Aeronautical Information Circulars (AIC), the pink ones are
related to safety and in particular [P 077/2009](http://www.ead.eurocontrol.int/eadbasic/pamslight-EAC66EE00F686F13BBA16C017CFC24E0/7FE5QZZF3FXUS/EN/AIC/P/077-2009/EG_Circ_2009_P_077_en_2009-09-10.pdf)
discusses 'Induction System Icing', commonly referred to as 'carburettor icing'.

When the fuel is vaporised there's a sudden drop in temperature, if the air is humid then
this rapid cooling can cause ice to start forming. If the air's humid enough this can even
occur with outside air temperatures over 20&deg;C. If the engine isn't producing much heat
(e.g. because it's idling while on the ground waiting for permission to taxi, or when
descending towards the runway) then ice can form causing a decrease in engine power; in
it's most severe form it can even cause the engine to stop.

To help remedy this the exhaust heat exchanger can be used to heat the intake air before
it reaches the carburettor. This is achieved by moving the carburettor heat control to its
HOT position.

When you do this, the engine will drop in power by about 100 RPM. You should leave it on
HOT for about 30 seconds and then switch it back to COLD. If the engine returns to its
previous power setting (e.g. you get the 100 RPM back) then no ice had formed. If,
however, you get back more than the 100 RPM then this indicates that ice was there before
and was reducing the total amount of available engine power. The carburettor heat has
melted the ice and you're now back to full engine capacity.

If this has happened then you would need to regularly apply carburettor heat to ensure no
build-up of ice, especially when the engine is idling, e.g. while descending. I hope that
helps demystify another aspect of learning to fly.
