Today we're going to be practising operating a lower levels. This is the type of flying
you'd do if the cloud base meant you couldn't fly higher, or if you're looking for a
suitable field to land in, or even if you're flying the circuit pattern at an airfield
with restricted airspace above it.

Derek briefs me on what to expect, explaining that ground features like hills will be much
more noticeable at lower levels. He also explains that the effect the wind has on our
flightpath is much more noticeable when we're closer to the ground. Also, down-drafts from
higher ground need to be considered when we're flying so close to the ground.

I go out to *Tango Lima* and run through the pre-flight checks while Derek books us out.
The crack in the engine pipe that was discovered after my flight [last week](/2016/04/17/day-44-lesson-24-first-solo-circuit-departure/)
really spooked me, so I take extra care and today and make sure I read my check list
properly and thoroughly inspect each part of the aeroplane.

## Take Off

By the time Derek joins me I've completed even the internal and starting checks. He
apologises for taking his time, explaining that he was talking with Mark, the resident
examiner. He takes charge and rushes us down the taxiway in an attempt to make up lost
time. But as we turn onto the runway Derek has positioned us facing the wrong way. I point
out this error and he calmly turns around and takes off in the correct direction. I can't
quite tell if this was intentional and he was making sure I would challenge authority when
safety was at risk, or if he genuinely made a mistake in his haste.

Our take off today was a short field take off. This is where we use the least amount of
runway we can. To do this the flaps are lowered to 25&deg; (which is the second stage of
flaps in the Piper PA28), then full power is applied while holding the breaks down. When
the propeller's RPM has reached maximum the breaks are released and then we pull back on
the control column to take off 10kts sooner than usual, which is to say we take off at
55kts not 65kts. But we don't climb, the nose is pushed back down and we accelerate while
in ground effect, just a few feet above the runway. When we've accelerated to 65kts we
begin the climb and at a safe altitude the flaps are retracted one stage at a time,
establishing a 75kts climb with the wings in a clean configuration.

## Operating at Lower Levels



 * Last week's crack in an engine pipe really spooked me, so I take extra care in the pre-flight checks
 * I complete the pre-flight checks and inform the tower we're ready to take off
 * We're told if we can do just a short backtrack we can take off, Derek takes the opportunity to demonstrate a short-field take off
 * But her turns onto runway 27, when we've been given take off clearance for runway 09.
 * I let him know and he simply says okay and turns the plane around. I wonder if it was a test to make sure I'd say anything if he was doing something wrong or dangerous.
 * Derek says we should apply 25&deg; of flap and keep the brakes on while increasing the throttle to full power.
 * Today's lesson is all about operating at lower levels
 * We descend to just a few hundred feet and observe how the wind blows us off track as I turn
 * We do 180 degree turns and then full 360 degree circles
 * Then we climb and practice some advanced turns
 * My turns to the right are okay, but I loose height turning left
 * Derek asks me to fly at different speeds, 70 knots, then 60 with flaps.
 * Observe sinking effect over the Mendips because of the wind
 * Then Derek asks me to do a powered off approach at Bristol, and it's still a heavy landing :-(
