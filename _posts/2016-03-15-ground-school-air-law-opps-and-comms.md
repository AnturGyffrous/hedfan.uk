This evening I met Nick at the club and we went through exam crammer sessions. We went
through three of the exams, Air Law, Operation Procedures and Communications. For each one
Nick showed me a presentation and discussed various aspects of each subject while I
furiously took down notes!

Nick is also one of the students at the club, but he now holds his Private Pilot Licence
(PPL) and is building up flying hours and revising for his exams so he can get his Airline
Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL) and become an airline pilot. He said that helping students
out with their exams helped keep him sharp revising for his.

After the sessions I bought a series of Question & Answer books to help my self paced
study and gauge my readiness for sitting the exams. I hope to be ready in a week or two.

#### TOTAL FLYING HOURS = 22.5

#### SOLO FLYING HOURS = 0.4
