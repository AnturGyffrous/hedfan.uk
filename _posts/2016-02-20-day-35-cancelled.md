The weather [last Saturday](/2016/02/13/day-34-cancelled-carburettor-heat/) had been
rubbish, but on Sunday it was lovely. Shame I didn't have a lesson booked. Typical!

Today the weather was awful so my lesson was *again* cancelled. I have another lesson
booked tomorrow but the weather was looking even worse then. So it doesn't look like I'll
be consolidating my [solo flying hours](/2016/01/30/day-32-lesson-17-first-solo/) this
weekend.

#### TOTAL FLYING HOURS = 18.7

#### SOLO FLYING HOURS = 0.4
