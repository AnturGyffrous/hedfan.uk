 * The weather's looking lovely today and I have a four hour booking with the aircraft
 * Think about where we could go, consider Kemble but decide that's too close
 * Instead we opt for the lovely sounding Halfpenny Green, just outside Wolverhampton in England's West Midlands
 * I realise it's pronounced *hape-nee green* not *half penny green*
 * I plan a route up the Wye valley, over Monmouth and Hereford, then North East to the aerodrome
 * Phil and his daughter Sarah are planning to fly there too, what a coincidence!
 * We take off and cross the Severn estuary. The weather's not quite a clear as I'd hoped, and we struggle to see Tintern Abbey
 * My wife is struggling with the many little, unpredictable movements a light aircraft makes
 * We switch to London Information, pass Hereford and then 10 miles out from Halfpenny Green switch over to their tower
 * I'm asked what join I'd like and I elect for an overhead join
 * We struggle to find the airfield, and don't make visual contact until just two miles out
 * I orientate myself above the airfield, descend on the dead side and fly over the runway threshold on the crosswind leg
 * Radio my position, completed the downwind checks and line up on finals behind a light aircraft landing ahead of me
 * He taxis off the runway at the opposite end and I'm cleared to land
 * It's a new airfield I've not been to before and I forget my CRAP checks as well as flare too late and land heavily
 * I'm disappointed by this. I thought I'd cracked landing :-(
 * We park next to the control tower, pay our landing fee and order some lunch in the cafe
 * Once finished it's time to start our return journey
 * I complete the pre-flight checks and taxi to the runway
 * We take off, head South over Kidderminster, Worcester and Tewkesbury
 * We see the huge GCHQ doughnut shaped building in Cheltenham and spot another light aircraft nearby
 * Then we follow the edge of the Cotswolds, looking out for gliders at Nympsfield
 * With a tail wind we're soon back over Bristol and are given permission to enter controlled airspace via Clifton Suspension Bridge
 * Like my last flight, it's another crosswind landing. I'm very nervous, especially after my heavy landing earlier
 * But I control the aircraft well, kick straight and flare for a smooth landing
