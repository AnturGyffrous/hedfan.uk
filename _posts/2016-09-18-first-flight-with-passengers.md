 * Need to have a checkout flight with an instructor before I can take passengers
 * Reminded that I need to have performed 3 take offs and landings in the past 90 days if I want to take passengers
 * Try to book out for circuits, but the aerodrome is busy with commercial traffic
 * So we leave via Cheddar Reservoir and do a stall and pretend go-around
 * Then back at the airport I'm allowed to do a touch-and-go
 * First landing I'm blown by the crosswind so don't land on the centreline, but it's a good landing.
 * Second landing is lined up better.
 * Flight can be logged as P.1/S, which counts as PIC time.
 * Then I take my wife and daughter out over Cheddar Reservoir, past Wells, over Bath, over the Severn Bridges and around Bristol.
 * Then I take my parents across the estuary and up the Wye Valley, over Monmouth and the Forest of Dean and back to Bristol.
