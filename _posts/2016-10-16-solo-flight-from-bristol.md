 * Was intending to take my in-laws but plane was changed at last minute and can only take one passenger, so decided to fly solo
 * The wind is coming from the North, meaning there'll be a crosswind, I hope I can land without too much trouble
 * Took off and departed the ATZ via Cheddar Reservoir
 * Then turned West towards Brean Down and the coast
 * Then turned North and flew past Western Super Mare
 * Phil as in the air flying a passenger on a trial lesson
 * Bristol Radar informed each of us of our position
 * I saw Phil's plane as I was approaching Clevedon
 * Kept wanting to turn East, but that would fly me into controlled airspace
 * Resolve to fly towards Newport, as that keeps me on the right track
 * Then I turn towards Portishead and re-join Bristol ATZ via the M5 Avon Bridge
 * Have to orbit at Barrow Tanks while commercial traffice lands
 * Controller thinks he can slot me in-between arrivals, so gets me to turn onto finals
 * But it's too close and he breaks me off
 * I orbit south of the airport while the jets behind me land
 * Then I'm cleared to land, there's a strong crosswind and it looks quite hairy to begin with
 * But I remain in control and land well, I'm very proud of that landing as crosswind landings are so difficult and I remember really struggling with them all weekend when training
