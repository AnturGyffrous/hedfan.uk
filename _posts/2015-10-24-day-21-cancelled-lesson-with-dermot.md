This weekend Derek was away, so my lesson was to be with Dermot, the first time I'd be
flying with someone other the Derek. I was both nervous and excited about this. Nervous
because I liked Derek and had got used to his style, excited because sometimes a change
can be as good as a rest; perhaps Dermot could help me sort out my landings.

But it wasn't to be. The good old British weather saw this opportunity off. Heavy rain and
low cloud meant no one would be flying at the club today.
