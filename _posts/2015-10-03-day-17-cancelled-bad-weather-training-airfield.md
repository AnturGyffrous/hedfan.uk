My lesson this morning was at 9am and the weather looked glorious. However, just 10 miles
away at Bristol airport, persistent morning fog meant my lesson was cancelled.

Interestingly, I'd been [reading on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Airport#RAF_Lulsgate_Bottom)
that the airport was originally established as a relief landing ground by the RAF in 1940.
It's geography made it ideal as a bad weather training airfield. This was all too apparent
today as the METAR reported fog with a visibility of just 50 metres:

    METAR EGGD 030720Z AUTO 06005KT 0050 R27/0150 FG VV/// 07/07 Q1016

It's amazing how the weather can change in a few miles. I spent the morning in Bristol's
Clifton Village, looking enviously up at the blue, haze free skies.
