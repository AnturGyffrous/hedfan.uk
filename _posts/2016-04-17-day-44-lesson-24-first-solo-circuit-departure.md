 * Derek says today he'd like to send me on a solo flight away from the airfield.
 * First we plan to do a couple of circuits to ensure I haven't forgotten anything important.
 * I need my memory jogged to switch on the fuel pump and carburettor heat, but other than that my first circuit is fine.
 * We have to land, not touch-and-go on the first landing because of wake turbulence.
 * Derek is happy with my one landing, so sends me on my solo then.
 * I leave via Cheddar Reservoir and spend the best part of an hour flying over Somerset, all on my own!
 * Really pleased to have consolidated more solo flight time.
 * My landings are okay (but could be a bit better).
 * The next pilot sees a crack in one of the engine pipes. He wants to know if it was there before I started, although I should have noticed a crack in the pipe, I can't be certain I checked it :-S
