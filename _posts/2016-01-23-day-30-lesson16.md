 * Derek is back from his holiday
 * The wind is blowing across the runway, not along it. It's also gusting
 * Derek suggests we prepare for a navigation exercise, so we plot a route via Cheddar, Glastonbury, Warminster & Radstock
 * We ask to attempt one circuit, but ATC can't allow us to change, we're either on circuits or we're not.
 * On the climbout the wind is really gusting, probably a good idea we're not doing circuits!
 * We get to 1,000 feet really quickly, I realise later it's because of the difference between QNH and QFE.
 * We exit via Cheddar and Derek gets me to identify features (including reservoir) to locate the town of Cheddar.
 * Then we turn to fly towards Glastonbury, noting the Tor, Street next to it and the river separating the two.
 * Next we turn to head towards Warminster, noting the town of Wells and it's TV mast.
 * We fly past Shepton Mallet and identify the high ground indicated on the map.
 * Derek points out a junction in a railway track and tells me this is how we can be sure of where we are.
 * We continue to Warminster and use the railway track and town of Frome to ensure we're at the right place.
 * Then we turn around and fly past Frome again and head to Radstock.
 * At this point we need to radio the controller to ask for permission to re-join the ATZ.
 * We spot Chew Valley Lake and Blagdon Lake.
 * Derek asks me where the airport is and I point straight past it!
 * He shows me where it is and then we identify Barrow Gurney Reservoir.
 * The altimeter shows we're at 1,600 feet when I'd normally be at 1,000 feet at this point in the circuit.
 * I think we'll have to descend fast, but our profile is no different to normal.
 * The landing is okay, but not as good as last week.
 * I realise later the altimeter difference is because of QNH and QFE!

#### TOTAL FLYING HOURS = 17.4
