The weather today looks beautiful, perfect for flying. I check the [METAR](/2015/07/12/day-4/)
and am pleased to see it report very light winds, visibility of 10km of more and no cloud:

    METAR EGGD 121420Z AUTO VRB03KT 9999 NCD 10/02 Q1030=

The [TAF](/2015/07/12/day-4/) also looks wonderful, forecasting that for the rest of the
day, the wind will be coming from 220&deg; at 5kts, visibility will be 10km or more and
the few clouds that are in the sky will have a base of 4,500 feet.

So, as you can imagine, I was surprised when the club phoned to say that my lesson might
not go ahead. It turns out that although visibility on the ground is perfect for flying,
because of haze, visibility aloft is very low. Apparently you can't even see Bristol City
from the airport, which is only about 5 miles away.

Fortunately, my lesson wasn't scheduled until late afternoon, by which time the haze had
cleared up enough for circuits. It wouldn't have been good enough for navigation, so I was
glad the wind was light with no crosswind.

Derek is away this weekend, so today I'm flying with Phil in *Tango Lima*. We have a chat
in one of the briefing rooms and go over what I have learnt so far. Phil suggests that
today we fly flapless approaches and landings. He explains that with no flap the stall
speed will be higher so we need to fly faster on the approach, 80kts instead of 70kts as
it would be with full flaps. He also gives me another check list he finds useful (and
amusing); he calls them the **CRAP** checks!

 * **C**arburettor - *off*
 * **R**unway - *clear*
 * **A**pproach - *looking good*
 * **P**ermission - *given to land*

As I'm taxing I see an easyJet plane taking off. The tower give me permission to enter the
runway and backtrack. I read back the instruction but say I don't need to backtrack.
However, the controller says if I line up at the intersection I'll have to wait 3 minutes
before I can take off, if I backtrack I will only have to wait 2 minutes, so I agree to
backtrack.

Phil explains this is to do with the wake turbulence created by the larger aeroplane
taking off. It will have used most of the runway before being fast enough to fly, so the
wake turbulence would have started a long way down the runway. If I wanted to take off
from the intersection, I would lift off at a similar point. Therefore, I would need to
wait 3 minutes for their wake turbulence to dissipate. If I backtracked to the start of
the runway, then I'd be fast enough to fly much earlier than the other plane, thus able to
climb above their wake turbulence. Hence I'd only have to wait 2 minutes before
starting my take off role.

For my first circuit Phil asks me to do a normal, full flap landing. The wind was calm so
my approach was fine and I touched down well; so much easier than the [crosswind landings](/2016/02/27/day-37-lesson18-circuits-in-crosswind/)
I'd struggled with two weeks ago.

On the second circuit I use partial flaps, going to just the second stage, not third. I'd
done this on some of the crosswind landings, so nothing much new here. However, not
deploying the third stage meant I forgot to turn the carburettor heat off. Phil says this
is the value of the **CRAP** checks, I have a check list as my prompt to turn the
carburettor heat off rather than using the third stag of flaps as a prompt.

Then, on the third circuit I do a flapless landing. I've become so used to putting the
first stage of flaps down when flying the base leg that it feels quite peculiar to still
have the wings in their clean configuration when approaching to land. I turn onto final,
flying at 80kts, and this time remember the **CRAP** checks. The first check, **C** for
turning the carburettor off, yields the first problem, I forgot to turn the carburettor
*on* when beginning my descent. My landing is a greaser though; I chuckle with delight
after the struggles I had landing with a crosswind.

We do another flapless approach and again I'm pleased with my landing. As we climb back up
to circuit height Phil takes the controls and talks me through a couple of areas he thinks
I can improve on. Firstly, I'm forgetting **P**itch in my [BUMPFFICHH](/2015/08/29/day-11-lesson-7/)
checks. Secondly, I'm reducing the throttle to idle too early when landing, this is making
me pitch down to maintain speed, something Phil refers to as a "*dirty dive to the
ground*". I should use height above the runway as my reference point for reducing the
throttle, rather than position over the threshold.

Phil gives the controls back to me for the last landing and again I touch down well. As I
taxi off the runway the controller asks to speak with my instructor over the radio and
says:

> Very neat circuits flown by Tango Lima. Almost exactly six minutes apart on the
> touchdown. I don't know if it's a good student or just good instruction.

To which Phil replies:

> It's a good student.

I chuckle out load and grin to myself. It's been such a boost to have a good lesson with
some great landings. Although I have the weather to thank for that I'm still very pleased.
Phil says that in tomorrow's lesson I can fly solo without doing any circuits with him
first, I'm chuffed to bits to hear that.
