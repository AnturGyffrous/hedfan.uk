 * Today we're going to cover radio navigation, PFLs and advanced turns
 * We take off and head towards the M5 Avon Bridge, but heavy shows and cloud force us to fly over Clevedon.
 * We cross the Severn estuary and pick up the Brecon beacon on the VOR.
 * Derek shows me how to tune in and identify the beacon using Morse code.
 * Then we find the right radial to fly towards the beacon and set our course.
 * Once over Wales Derek gets me to try a few advanced turns.
 * Then we continue tracking the beacon and Derek shows how the needle becomes more sensitive as we get close
 * We fly over the beacon and see the instrument change from To to FROM.
 * Then we intercept a course from the beacon to Badminton.
 * While on-route Derek shows me how to use SkyDemon and shows how the beacon becomes less accurate the further away from it we are.
 * Once at Badminton we do a few PFLs followed by forced landings after take-off. I'm still not entirely happy with my efforts.
 * We fly out to fields between the two Severn bridges and practice several more PFLs.
 * I think I'm just about getting there.
 * We return via Clifton Suspension Bridge and Derek asks me to do a performance landing as if we're on a short field.
 * This goes okay but Derek reminds me to pull back on the elevator control once we've landed to help slow us down.
