 * Crosswinds again
 * Both me and Martin (a fellow PPL student) are in circuits at the same time
 * Derek shows me that the crosswind component is about 10 knots, plane can handle 17 knots, pilot only about 3!
 * Finding it hard to relax, landings are really difficult
 * Derek takes control for one approach and landing to show how it should be little movements
 * Last couple of landings were okay, but I feel quite disappointed with today's effort
