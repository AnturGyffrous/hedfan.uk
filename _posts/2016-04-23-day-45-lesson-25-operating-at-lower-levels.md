 * Last week's crack in an engine pipe really spooked me, so I take extra care in the pre-flight checks
 * I complete the pre-flight checks and inform the tower we're ready to take off
 * We're told if we can do just a short backtrack we can take off, Derek takes the opportunity to demonstrate a short-field take off
 * But her turns onto runway 27, when we've been given take off clearance for runway 09.
 * I let him know and he simply says okay and turns the plane around. I wonder if it was a test to make sure I'd say anything if he was doing something wrong or dangerous.
 * Derek says we should apply 25&deg; of flap and keep the brakes on while increasing the throttle to full power.
 * Today's lesson is all about operating at lower levels
 * We descend to just a few hundred feet and observe how the wind blows us off track as I turn
 * We do 180 degree turns and then full 360 degree circles
 * Then we climb and practice some advanced turns
 * My turns to the right are okay, but I loose height turning left
 * Derek asks me to fly at different speeds, 70 knots, then 60 with flaps.
 * Observe sinking effect over the Mendips because of the wind
 * Then Derek asks me to do a powered off approach at Bristol, and it's still a heavy landing :-(
