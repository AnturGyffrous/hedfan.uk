 * TAF and METAR look perfect for flying.
 * But the club phones to say visibility aloft is very low because of haze.
 * I call the club just before my lesson and they say it's just about okay.
 * Today, I'm flying whith a different instructor, Phil. We spend a while going over what I've learnt and re-capping the circuit.
 * Phil gives me a new landing checklist, CRAP, Carburettor Heat, Runway Clear, Approach Good and Permission Given.
 * Phil suggests we do flapless landings today.
 * We start with a full flap landing and I'm pleased with it. My first good landing since my solo!
 * The second one is a semi-flapless landing, just two stages, not three. The landing is fine, but I forget the carburettor heat, must learn CRAP.
 * Third landing is a flapless one, so CRAP is important, I get to C and realise I forgot to turn carburettor heat ON! The landing is good though.
 * Fourth landing is also flapless. This time I remember carburettor heat and CRAP. The landing is good again.
 * Fifth landing is a full flap one and goes well.
 * Controller asks to speak to the instructor and congratulates us on perfect circuits, 6 minutes each.
 * Feel really chuffed
 * But, I'm forgetting Pitch in my BUMPFFICHH checks, not always straight on landing and must check RPM returns to normal after carburettor heat.
 * Phil also reminds me of the Lights, Camera, Action checklist when about to enter the runway
 * Must remember to idle the throttle when testing the breaks at start.
