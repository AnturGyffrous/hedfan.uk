Since my [last lesson](2015/11/22/day-26-lesson-14-circuit-bashing/) I'd been away so
hadn't been able to fly the previous 3 weekends, I was really hoping to get in the air
today, especially as Derek had said I was ready to go solo, but cloud and rain meant my
lesson was cancelled. As Christmas is just around the corner I won't get to fly for a
while now.

Instead, I'll spend the festive season reading more of the [Communications](http://www.pooleys.com/prod_detail.cfm?product_id=5)
volume of the Air Pilot's Manuals, as Derek said my radio telecommunications needed some
work.

#### TOTAL FLYING HOURS = 15.5
