[Last weekend](/2016/02/27/day-37-lesson18-circuits-in-crosswind/) had been challenging, a
strong crosswind with gusts meant that even though I flew on both Saturday and Sunday; and
completed a total of 13 take offs and landings, I still didn't manage to fly any of them
solo. Derek felt I wasn't quite confident enough to handle a crosswind landing on my own.

Today there's still a crosswind so we're giving the touch-and-goes a rest and instead
going on a navigation exercise to [Kemble (Cotswolds Airport)](http://www.cotswoldairport.com/).
For this I have had to create a PLOG (pilot's log) that not only calculates our distance
and direction over ground, but also accounts for the wind, magnetic variation, air
pressure and temperature.

The [Navigation](http://www.pooleys.com/prod_detail.cfm?product_id=9)] book (volume three
of the Air Pilot's Manuals) was crucial in understanding how to work all this out, it also
taught me how to use my 'whiz-wheel'. [Last November](/2015/11/08/day-23-cancelled-flight-equipment/)
I was given the [Pooleys CRP-1W Computer](http://www.pooleys.com/prod_detail.cfm?product_id=2504)
which includes a 'wind arm'. I had no idea what that meant back then, but now I've learnt
how to use it I think I should have chosen the standard CRP-1, the one without the wind
arm (signified by the 'W' at the end of the product code).

 * Bought my own headset, a David Clark H10-13.4 for &pound;305
 * I calculate a flight log to Kemble and back using my whizz-wheel and forecast winds.
 * Still a strong crosswind, so Derek decides we'll just fly over Kemble, we won't land
 * Pencil lead breaks so I have to dig into my bag for a replacement, the only thing I can find is my red pen!
 * I take off west on 09 and turn right towards Bristol City and Clifton Suspension Bridge
 * Once over the bridge I can climb to 2,500 feet.
 * We fly past the now closed Filton airfield and then over the town of Yate
 * Derek points out the long grass strip at Badminton (where the horse trials are held), it take me a while to see it.
 * I identify Tetbury in the distance and ensure we're above 2,000 feet while flying over Prince Charles' estate.
 * Then I switch to Kemble Information and give them my position and intentions.
 * We overfly and try to see the landing square, but it's not out today.
 * Then we return towards Bristol, the sun is in my eyes and I find it hard to identify distant features
 * Also, I only visualised the flight on the map going to Kemble, not coming back, so I'm a bit all over the place.
 * I fly over Tetbury again and switch back to Bristol Radar (LARS)
 * Then I see Badminton to my left and Yate ahead with Bristol in the distance.
 * The sun means it's still difficult to see features and I can't find the suspension bridge, but I can see Clifton Downs, so aim for that.
 * I contact Bristol Tower and am given permission to enter controlled airspace.
 * My landing instructions are to join right base at Barrow Tanks behind the aircraft on long final.

Golf Tango Lima is commencing an orbit

Golf Tango Lima, roger. The traffic you're looking for is at four and a half miles

Visual with the traffic, Golf Tango Lima

Golf Tango Lima, report final, number two, follow the Embraer. Caution, the wake turbulence recommended spacing is five miles

Wilko, thank you

You should repeat that really, because he said you're number two and the wake turbulence distance was five miles, so you should really repeat that. I'd say "Number two and copy the wake turbulence distance"

 * I am visual with the plane, so extend downwind for wake turbulence and then turn base and final.
 * It's still a crosswind so I'm pointing into wind. As I kick straight my death grip on the controls makes for a scary and bunpy landing.
 * Still struggling with crosswinds. This is bad :-(
