The weather [last Saturday](/2016/02/13/day-34-cancelled-carburettor-heat/) had been
rubbish, but on Sunday it was lovely. Shame I didn't have a lesson booked. Typical!

Today the weather was awful so my lesson was *again* cancelled. I have another lesson
booked tomorrow but the weather is looking even worse then. So it doesn't look like I'll
be consolidating my solo flying hours this weekend.

I was on such a high after my [first solo](/2016/01/30/day-32-lesson-17-first-solo/) and
really hoped to get out flying solo again soon. Now I'm worried I'll have lost momentum
and will need more lessons before being allowed to fly on my own again.

#### TOTAL FLYING HOURS = 18.7

#### SOLO FLYING HOURS = 0.4
