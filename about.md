Welcome to my blog, Hedfan. First, let me introduce myself; my name is Owain, I am in my
mid-thirties and I live in Bristol in the South West of England. I started this blog as
I've been fascinated with flight since I can remember and wanted to share my passion for
aviation with others.

I've always loved the thrill of powering down the runway in an aeroplane, that force
pushing you back into the seat as the craft accelerates to take-off speed is exhilarating.
And while others were daunted by airports I've always found them exciting. As a child I
was invited into the cockpit of a Boeing 747 mid-flight and was awestruck. I've played
flight simulation games, been a member of a Virtual Airline, been aboard Concorde
(admittedly only on the ground in a museum, but that still counts right?), parachuted out
of an aeroplane and in June 2015 I started learning to fly light aircraft with
[The Bristol and Wessex Aeroplane Club](http://www.bristolandwessex.co.uk/).

So why Hedfan? Well, I was brought up in Wales, not England. Hedfan is the Welsh word for
flight or flying (actually, "hedegog" is probably a closer translation to flying, "hedfan"
just means flight, but it's shorter and easier to say, so that's why I chose it!) In
Welsh, a single 'f' makes a 'v' sound, so you pronounce it "head-van".

Croeso i hedfan.
