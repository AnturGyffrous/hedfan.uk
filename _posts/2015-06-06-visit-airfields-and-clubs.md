Inspired by Jason Smart's book [Take Your Wings and Fly - A Journey Through a Private Pilot's Licence](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Take-Your-Wings-Fly-Journey/dp/0956718752) I wanted to learn more about the flying clubs and schools near me.

After some research I discovered several options near Bristol, where I live. The most obvious airfield as fas as proximity is concerned is Bristol International Airport (EGGD), but both Cotswold Airport, formerly RAF Kemble (EGBP) and Gloucestershire Airport (EGBJ) are within commuting distance.

After a few emails and phone calls I whittled down my list to [The Bristol and Wessex Aeroplane Club](http://www.bristolandwessex.co.uk/) at Bristol International Airport and [Bristol Aero Club](http://www.bristolaeroclub.co.uk/) at Kemble (I tried to refer to it as Cotswold Airport, but now realise everyone in the aviation industry calls Kemble!)

I drove over to both clubs and met some of the instructors and staff. I was very impressed with what they had to offer, everyone was friendly and talked me through what would be involved. I had lots of questions, here are some of them along with a summary of what I was told:

* ***How long does it take to learn to fly?***

    That depends on what licence you want to gain and your own proficiency. There are legal minimums that you must reach regardless of your abilities, the Light Aircraft Pilot Licence (LAPL) requires a minimum of 30 hours flying training and the Private Pilot Licence (PPL) requires 45 hours.

	However, it may take longer than this before you are proficient enough to pass the skills test. It will also depend on how often you can fly which may be dictated by aircraft availability, weather and your own commitments. Many people take more than 55 hours to pass their PPL, with the average closer to 65 hours.

	If you can fly at least once a week and can get through the syllabus and exams then you should be able to get your licence in a year to 18 months.

* ***What about the NPPL?***

    The National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) allows pilots to fly as a hobby in the UK in light aircraft on an unpaid and non-commercial basis. You can't use it to fly abroad and can't carry more than 3 passengers. The NPPL is still being issued today but it is being phased out in favour of the LAPL, which although also limited to unpaid, non-commercial flying, can be used in Europe as well as the UK.

* ***What counts as a flying hour?***

    Once the engine is running you can start the clock. So if you spend 10 minutes taxiing and 50 minutes flying, this counts as a full hour as far as your flight log is concerned. If you have to hold short while other aircraft take off and land, this all counts towards your flying hours.

* ***Is there a time limit on getting your licence once you start training?***

    No, you can take as long as you like. An hour logged today will still count in several years time. However, there is an 18 month limit on passing your skills test once you take the first theory exam. If you take longer than 18 months then you'll have to re-take any theory tests that have elapsed.

* ***Are there any prerequisites to flying solo?***

   Both the PPL and the LAPL require you log a certain amount of solo flight time before you can pass the skills test. It is a legal requirement that you hold a suitable medical certificate before you can fly solo. Some clubs also require that you pass the Air Law theory exam, but this isn't a legal requirement.

* ***Changing instructor or transferring hours to another club***
* ***Additional Ratings***
* ***Flying hours when renting aircraft***

In the end I opted for The Bristol and Wessex Aeroplane Club at Bristol International Airport...
