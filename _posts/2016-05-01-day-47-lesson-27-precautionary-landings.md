 * Today we're practising precautionary landings
 * We'd do this if the weather came in and we couldn't continue or return
 * Or perhaps if we were running out of daylight or fuel, but you should *never* run out of fuel and even in dark it's probably safer to push on
 * Derek demonstrates a low search, circuit and approach
 * Then it's my turn, I notice a field with a line in it, it turns out to be a farmer's landing strip, that'll do!
 * Getting in very close it's easy to see high tension power cables and fences that need to be avoided
 * Then we have another go and I identify another field and do a circuit and low approach.
 * Next week we'll fly to Kemble, then I'll go solo, after that we'll do Swansea, and then it's my QCC!
