[Yesterday's haze](/2016/03/12/day-40-lesson21-flapless-landings/) hasn't got any better.
In fact, if anything it's got worse. Even though it looks like a beautiful day at ground
level, I'm told the visibility aloft is appalling, so my lesson is cancelled.

Apparently, this weather phenomenon is known as an inversion. Usually, the air temperature
decreases with height. But in an inversion the temperature actually increases as you get
higher. Up until a point. After that the temperature drops with altitude. If you flew
above the inversion the weather would be clear, perfect flying weather. Unfortunately
that's no good for circuits and solo flying.
