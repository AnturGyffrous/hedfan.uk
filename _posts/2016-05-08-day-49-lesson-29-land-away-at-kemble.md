 * We couldn't fly to Kemble yesterday because of the weather, this morning it's not looking great either, but the forecast is set to improve, so we wait it out and discuss my PLOG
 * By 10am the weather's improved so we make out way out to the aeroplane and head for Kemble via Clifton Suspension Bridge
 * Climb out over Bristol city, look for the motorways, Yate and the railway lines
 * Badminton is having the horse trials, so the fields are full of motor homes and caravans, making it very easy to spot!
 * I radio Kemble but give my height wrong, I've descended a 1,000 feet!
 * I complete an over-head join and land fairly well, but pull back too much and take off again, I touch down well a second time.
 * Derek says they were two lovely landings, hopefully I won't be charged twice!
 * I pay my landing fee, return to the plane and take off
 * Once at 500 feet I turn to my heading and look for Tetbury, I can see a town in the right direction, but there shouldn't be another to the right
 * Turns out I'm flying towards Malmesbury, as I took off I was too far east when I turned
 * Derek says he's pleased I identified the issue and found my way, in future I should fly 45&deg over my intended track until I identify features I recognise and then turn onto track
 * We return to Bristol, but I muck up my call to Bristol Radar. Not quite sure why?!
 * I return to the club at 3pm to fly to Kemble solo, I prepare my PLOG and phone Kemble to book in
 * But I'm greeted with bad news, there's a 15 knot crosswind which is gusting 27 knots at times.
 * Derek and I agree it's too much for me to handle, so we cancel my solo :-(
