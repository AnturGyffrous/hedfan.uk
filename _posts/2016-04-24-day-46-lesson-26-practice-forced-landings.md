 * Today we're practising forced landings without power
 * Derek briefs me on the procedure then we're off.
 * I do a short field take off, but the RPM only rises to about 2,200, nevertheless we continue with the take off role and pull back at about 50kts, and climb out at about 60kts.
 * I'm reminded not to retract the flaps until above 300 feet, as I may sink and I wouldn't want to sink if I'm only just clearing obstacles.
 * ENGINE FAILURE! (well, at least that's what Derek says as he reduces throttle to idle)
 * Maintain altitude by holding the nose up, we can afford to loose some speed in favour of not loosing altitude (if we were flying very fast we could even start to climb, to *gain* altitude in favour of speed)
 * Then change fuel tanks (in case the the engine failure is actually fuel starvation due to running out of fuel in one tank, or it being contaminated)
 * Now look for a field to land in, 5S's.
 * Derek spots a field and chooses a 1,000 foot marker. Maintaining 70kts as we start to descend.
 * In a real-world situation we'd try to re-start the engine, but Derek tells me to assume we've tried all that and we can't start the engine.
 * As we approach the 1,000 foot marker Derek warms the engine (we wouldn't be able to do this in the real world!)
 * We turn onto final as we cross the marker and decide we're a little low so don't put any flaps on yet. We spot power lines and are happy we'll clear those.
 * When it looks like we'll land half way into the field the first stage of flaps goes on, but the drag from this means we'll now no longer reach the middle, more likely a quarter of the way in.
 * As we approach and are more confident we'll be able to land in the field without falling short the other stages of flaps are incrementally applied.
 * Then, just a hundred or so feet from a forced landing in a field then engine springs back to life (with a little help from Derek pushing the throttle forward) and we climb out as if going around. Phew!
 * Now it's my turn, so we climb back up to 2,000 feet before 
 * Then I have a go, but it's all too tight
 * On my next attempt I turn with the wind behind me
 * Third attempt is a bit better, but I'm still too high
